- **Team Collaboration**: Add teammates to events and view their availability with profile avatars (using `@radix-ui/react-avatar`) and interactive popovers (via `@radix-ui/react-popover`).
- **Date Picking**: Select dates effortlessly with an integrated date picker (powered by `react-day-picker` and `date-fns` for date manipulation).
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, thanks to Tailwind CSSâ€™s responsive utilities.
- **Theme Support**: Toggle between light and dark modes with `next-themes`, enhancing accessibility and user comfort.
